# Svelte project scaffold with TypeScript and Tailwind configured

Svelte is a modern front-end web framework that is blazing fast, easy to use and production ready. As per the [stateofjs survey](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/libraries/front-end-frameworks/), svelte is ranked right there at the top (*#2*).
 
Svelte coupled with **TypeScript** support enables developers to create fast, smooth, performant, compiled JS-rendered web-apps in no time.


Tailwind.css on the other hand is a utility-first CSS library that has gained huge popularity in the recent years. As per [stateofcss survey](https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/css-frameworks/), Tailwind is ranked as the **#1** styling library as of 2022-23.


This repo creates a minimal **Svelte** app scaffold with **TypeScript** support as well as **Tailwind CSS** configured. It uses *Vite* as the build-tool.

To get started, here are the steps you need to complete :
1. Download the repository in *.zip* format or `git clone` the repository in your workspace
2. Once forked, run `npm install` from your workspace terminal.
3. You are now ready to spin up a development or production server using the *npm scripts* inside the *package.json* file
 
## That's it! 

You have successfully installed `svelte-ts-tailwind` and you are ready to build your beautiful app. Happy coding 

*PS: this project uses Vite and **NOT** SvelteKit.*
